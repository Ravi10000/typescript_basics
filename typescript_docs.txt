Convert .ts file to .js file
    • tsc <filename>.ts

Don't produce .js file if there's errors in .ts file
    • tsc --noEmitOnError <filename>.ts

Target a specific version of javascript
    • tsc --target es2015 <filename>.ts

Two important flags in typescript type checking
    • noImplicitAny - show errors for implicit type any
    • strictNullChecks - show errors for value of a variable can possibly be null | undefined

Types in typescript
    • string | number | boolean
    • number[] is equivalent to Array<number>
    • tuple is an array where we know exactly how many elements are there
      and types of all elements in specific positions 
      e.g. [number, string, boolean], [0] = number, [1] = string and [2] = boolean
    • any types doesn't get type-checked
    • Type annotations will always go after the thing being typed
      e.g. const num : number;
    • Even if you don’t have type annotations on your parameters, 
      TypeScript will still check that you passed the right number of arguments.
    • object - any javascript value with properties, which is almost all of them
    • type annotations in object can be separated by , | ;
      e.g. {x: number, y: number} | {x: number; y: number} 
      (personal preference ; - this distinguishes type annotations from a real object definitions)
